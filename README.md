I knocked on the doors of Udemy, Coursera, and Hackerrank before I was at the front door of DataCamp.

Hence, I was naturally doubtful about what it could offer different from the other platforms.

To my surprise, I found several guided and unguided projects I could complete on this platform. It ensures that I will remain a datacamper, at least for a while from now.

This repository holds the code for one of the guided SQL projects on the DataCamp's platform. It deals with analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores.

Two things that intrigued me while doing this project were:

1. I could write a SQL query in Jupyter Notebook (surprise!!)
2. Schools in Staten Island have a higher average SAT score than those in Brooklyn or Bronx. It might seem like another boring stat, but the database used for this analysis has only ten schools from Staten Island, whereas around 100 schools each for both Brooklyn & Bronx. It helped me realize how stats reported based on imbalanced data like this could be misleading.

I only had to write nine queries to complete this little project. Nevertheless, I still had fun!
